          This website would like to share with you the effects of the COVID-19
          pandemic on attendance in UK universities. It highlights a comparison
          and insights associated with the pandemic and university attendance
          before, during, and after the pandemic (between 2020 and 2024). A
          comparative perspective will also account for patterns in Pakistan.

          The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected various parts of learning
          activities in schools globally. The notable aspect is the effects on a
          typical study program. Following UK government interventions to
          contain the virus spread by reducing contact and closeness in public
          spaces, schools embraced virtual learning via different digital
          platforms. The method proved effective despite accompanying issues
          such as disparities in access to learning resources in regions with
          limited supportive educational resources. A US-based study revealed a
          statistically significant negative relationship between the pandemic
          and college enrolment for all universities in Texas (Korotchenko and
          Dobbs, 2023, p. 1). However, other empirical evidence shows that a
          shift from campus-based lectures to digital ones because of pandemic
          guidelines showed a significantly higher attendance rate, thus
          suggesting the effectiveness of online learning (Haugom, 2022, p. 1)
